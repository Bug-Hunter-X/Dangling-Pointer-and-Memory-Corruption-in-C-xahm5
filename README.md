This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a common error: attempting to free memory that was not dynamically allocated using `malloc()`.  The code incorrectly uses `free()` on a pointer to a stack variable, leading to undefined behavior, likely a segmentation fault or crash.  The solution provides the correct way to handle memory allocation and deallocation in C to avoid this error.
